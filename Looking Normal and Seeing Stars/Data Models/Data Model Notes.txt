* These data models were created or updated with ER/Studio 18.3. 

* These are logical models. Physical models have not been created yet.

* Since our interest in these models for the purpose of the session is to pay attention to the keys and columns, these models have not 
	been completely developed. For example, data types have not been clean up yet but will be at some point. So just ignore the
	data types for now.
